This is a two-player escape room written in Python. I created it during a 24 hour hackathon and centered it around the theme of community building. The players are locked in separate rooms in a cabin but are able to talk to each other. When playing, each player should run of the room scripts, and players should not look at each other's screens, but they must communicate and work together to escape in time!
